# Task3 AI and Robotics 

The second task in the artificial intelligence track talks about using object recognition technology to identify objects that the robot can encounter.

In this task, I will use the Teachable Machine program to enable the robot to recognize objects.

## - First, download examples before training the model.

### - Secondly, splitting examples into classes:

 Class 1:

 Class 2:

 Class 3:

#### - After dividing the classes, we train the model to be able to recognize objects.

##### - After completing the model training, we test it on examples and see if it will match with a high percentage with similar classes or not.

First Class: The Output was 98% for Class 1.

 Second Class: The Output was 99% for Class 2.

 Third Class: The Output was 98% for Class 3.
